Hello,

This code was created to deal with the Citation issue in Latex files for academics when moving from Papers 1 to Papers 2.

Requirements: 
1) BibTex file generated from Papers 1.
2) BibTex file generated from Papers 2.
3) LaTex file with Papers 1 citations in it.

Papers software: http://www.mekentosj.com/papers/
LaTex: http://www.latex-project.org/
BibTex: http://www.bibtex.org/ 

I understand the code is a little repetitive. I did this to ensure I could work out errors on each line, while also getting to grips with Python.
This is my first python script.
If you have any development improvements please feel free to suggest etc.
feel free to get in contact.

Tim Crawford
